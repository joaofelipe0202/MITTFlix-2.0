## MITTFlix 2.0

React project to search movies in a database, where the user can add one or more films in a list with his/her favorites movies.

#### To start this app

To start this app, you will need to run 2 separate commands.

- `npm run db`

This will start the database so your app actually has movies to query. The database runs on port 3001 just in case you need that info.

- `npm start`

This starts up the actual app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
